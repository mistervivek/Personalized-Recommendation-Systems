# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The system provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and historical interactions.

## Overview

Recommendation systems play a crucial role in enhancing user experience by suggesting relevant content based on their interests and preferences. This movie recommendation system aims to deliver personalized movie suggestions to users, thereby improving user engagement and satisfaction.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the MovieLens dataset, which contains movie ratings provided by users. The dataset consists of user-item interactions, including user ratings for various movies.

Dataset Source: Kaggle

## Model Implementation

This project implements collaborative filtering techniques for movie recommendation:

- **User-based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies to a user based on the preferences of users with similar tastes.
- **Item-based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies similar to those the user has liked or rated highly.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates. Convert the dataset into the required format for training recommendation models.

2. **Model Training:** Train the collaborative filtering models using the preprocessed dataset. Use algorithms like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Alternating Least Squares (ALS) for model training.

3. **Recommendation Generation:** Generate personalized movie recommendations for users based on their historical interactions and preferences. Evaluate the recommendation models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

4. **Deployment:** Deploy the recommendation system on a web server or cloud platform. Integrate the system with an application or website to provide real-time movie recommendations to users.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (for data preprocessing and model training)
- Streamlit (for backend development)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for frontend development)

## Future Enhancements

- Explore deep learning models like Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) for more accurate and personalized recommendations.
- Incorporate additional features such as movie genres, actors, and directors to improve recommendation quality.
- Implement user feedback mechanisms to further personalize recommendations based on user interactions.
